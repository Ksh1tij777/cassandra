# Cassandra — The Meta-Agent That Watches Other Agents

> An AI agent that babysits other AI agents. Cassandra watches production agents through
> Arize Phoenix traces, catches hallucinations, prompt drift, and tool-call failures in
> real time, auto-synthesizes evaluation datasets from the failing traces, runs
> LLM-as-judge evaluations, and proposes A/B-ready prompt patches — all from inside Phoenix.

**Hackathon:** Google Cloud Rapid Agent Hackathon — *Building Agents for Real-World Challenges*
**Partner track:** Arize (Phoenix — LLM observability & evaluation)
**Submission deadline:** 2026-06-12 02:30 IST (= 2026-06-11 14:00 PDT) · internal ship target 2026-06-11

## The Problem

Every team running LLM agents in production has the same unsolved problem: **agents fail
silently.** A customer-facing agent confidently invents a refund policy. A prompt drifts
after a model upgrade. A tool call fails and the agent hallucinates around the gap.

Today this is caught by **humans staring at dashboards**, sampling traces by hand, writing
eval datasets manually, and editing prompts on intuition. It does not scale, it is slow,
and most failures are never caught at all.

## The Idea

Cassandra closes that loop autonomously. It is, recursively, **an agent whose job is to
supervise other agents.** It runs the exact workflow Phoenix was built for — but
automated, continuous, and self-improving:

```
 monitor ─▶ diagnose ─▶ synthesize evals ─▶ run experiment ─▶ propose patch ─▶ (loop)
```

## Why This Wins the Arize Bucket

- **Quality of the Idea (25%)** — A beautifully recursive concept: an agent that audits
  agents. Almost every other entry will *be* an agent; almost none will be an agent
  *about* agents. Memorable and original.
- **Technological Implementation (25%)** — Exercises nearly the entire Phoenix MCP tool
  surface: traces, spans, annotations, datasets, experiments, prompt management. Arize
  judges are Phoenix engineers; this is non-trivial, deep, on-product usage.
- **Potential Impact (25%)** — Every production LLM team has this exact pain and currently
  solves it with eyeballs.
- **Design (25%)** — A live dashboard where a failure is caught, annotated, turned into a
  dataset, and patched — visibly, in seconds, on camera.

## Tech Stack

- **Reasoning core:** Gemini 3 (or direct OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` / `gpt-4o` integration)
- **Orchestration:** Google Cloud Agent Builder (the officially named build path) —
  `LoopAgent` + `SequentialAgent` via ADK/Agent Engine as the underlying runtime
- **Runtime:** Vertex AI Agent Engine
- **Partner MCP (required):** Arize Phoenix MCP server (`@arizeai/phoenix-mcp`)
- **Scheduling:** Cloud Functions (trace poller)
- **UI / hosting:** Cloud Run (dashboard)
- **Secrets:** Secret Manager
- **Optional:** BigQuery (long-term span analytics)

## Run Locally

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env            # Fill in OpenAI/Gemini API keys + Phoenix URLs

# 1. Start the Patient Agent (ShopBot)
uvicorn patient.agent:app --port 8082 --reload

# 2. Start the FastAPI Dashboard (serves the self-contained cockpit at http://localhost:8085)
uvicorn dashboard.main:app --port 8085 --reload

# 3. Drive one supervision cycle (seed an incident, poll, diagnose, patch, replay, red-team)
python scripts/run_pipeline.py

# Run offline unit tests
pytest
```

> The cockpit is a single self-contained file (`dashboard/ui/index.html`) served directly by
> the dashboard — no Node/Vite build step. The legacy `web/` React app is no longer wired in.
